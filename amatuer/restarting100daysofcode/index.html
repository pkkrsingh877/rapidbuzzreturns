        I'm back at it again. I sure lost my way there but I'll start coding for 1 hours everyday. I've decided that I'll not post the improvements on twitter but I'll write about it every single day.

            I should just grow up. It's okay if I want to watch anime but in limited amout like 1 per day. Watching 10 or 20 episodes per day will hurt me badly. I get habitutated to these things pretty quickly. And I should stop watching those. They make me lose my mind. I can't control myself once I start watching those.

            One good thing that happend is that I started learning C again. I'm starting to have a little fun while solving problems now which is a really good thing.
            I have to do these three things daily if I want to ever succeed.
