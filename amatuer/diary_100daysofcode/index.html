                    I've been wanting to create someting for quite a while now and was looking for some idea. Now I know exactly what I've gotta do. I'll create my own diary. I love to write and I do buy diaries. So I thought why not create my own diary using HTML.

                <section id=2>
                    Here's what I'm gonna do. I'll design a homepage and name it index.html . Then I'll create a list.html file and link the two. I'll keep the link of all my entries on link.html webpage.
