One of the primary causes of environmental degradation in a country could be attributed to rapid growth of population, which adversaly affects the natural resources and environment.
The three basic demographic factors of <i>births (natality), deaths (mortality)</i> and <i>migration</i> and <i>immigration</i> (population moving into a country produce changes  in population size, composition, distribution and these changes raise a number of questions of important questions of cause and effect.<p>
Population growth and economic developement are contributing to many serious environmental calamities in India. 
These include heavy pressure on land, land degradation, forests, habitat destrution and loss of biodiversity.
Changing consumption pattern has led to rising demand for energy. The final outcomes of this are air pollution, global warming, climate change, water scarcity and water pollution.<p>
Environmental issues in India include various natural hazards, particularly cyclones and annual monsoon floods, population growth, increasing individual consumption, industrialization, infrastructural developements, poor agricultural practices, and resource maldistribution have led to substantial human transformation of India's natural environment.<p>

Out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992) . 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Gangas River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as other developing  countries.
<P>
Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.<P>
More than 400 million people live along the Ganga River. An estimated 2,000,000 people ritually bathe daily in the river, which is considered holy by Indians.

To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll along the Gangas in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hinduism sacred river contain 60,000 faecal coliform bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing. Four miles downstream, with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3000 times over the safty limit. In places, the Gangas becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded babies, drift slowly by.<p>

<B> NewsWeek</B> describes Delhi's sacred Yamuna River as "a putrid ribbon of black sludge" where fecal bacteria is 10,000 over safty limits despite  15-year program to address the problem. Cholera epidemics are not unknown. <P>

AIR POLLUTION </H3> </A> </FONT>
<P>

Indian cities are polluted by vehicles and industry emissions. Road dust due to vehicles also contributing upto 33% of air pollution. In cities like Banglore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma. India has emission standard of Bharat Stage II (Euro II) for vehicles since 2005. <P> 
One of the biggest causes of air pollution in India is from of transport system. Hundreds of millions of old diesel engines continuously burning away diesel which has anything between 150 to 190 times the asmount of sulphar out European diesel has. <P>
It also appeared that the excessive pollution was having an adverse effect on Taj Mahal.
<P>
 Environmental pollution is a global problem and the whole humanity is worried as how to control it. Each nation is trying its best to reduce the polluting factors to save the human life. With the new advanced research analyses, through satellites, man has been able to find the cause of depletion of Ozone layer and its consequent effects. They talk about pollution through excessive refrigeration, fuel burning, industrial pollution and other such factors, but nobody has been able to imagine about the pollution being caused by the dead bodies when cosigned for cremation in non-scientific manner. We cry about the problem but no problem can be solved unless you provide an alternate or solution to it. The four areas identified for pollution namely Air, Water, Earth and Space, have been well researched and discovered. The visible areas to human eye - Earth and Water, catch easily the attention but the other two areas of Air and Space, which are invisible to the common eyesight, are under constant study, vigil and remedial efforts.<P>

The supreme court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005. <P>
Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution in residential areas.<P>
Land pollution in India is due to pesticides and fertilizers as well as corrosion.<P>
