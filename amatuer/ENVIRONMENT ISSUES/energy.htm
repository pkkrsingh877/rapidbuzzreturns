ENERGY CONSERVATION
</H1>

<font face="verdana" size="3"><p>
Energy Conservation is the practice of decreasing the quantity of energy used. It may be achived through efficient energy use, in which case energy use is decerased while achieving a similar outcome, or by reduced consumption of energy services. Energy conservation may result in increase of financial capital, environmental value, national security, personal security, and human comfort. 
Individuals and Organizations that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce energy costs and promote economic security, Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize profit.<p>
Electrical energy conservation is an important element of energy policy. Energy conservation reduces the energy consumption and energy demand per capita amd thus offsets some of the growth in energy supply needed to keep up with population growth. This reduces the rise in energy costs, and can reduce the need for new power plants, and energy imports. The reduced energy demands can provide more flexibility in choosing the most preferred methods of energy production.
<p>
By reducing emissions, energy conservation is an important part of lessening climate change. Energy conservation facilitates the replacement of non-renewable resources with renewable energy. Energy conservation is often the most economical solution to all the energy shortages, and is more environmentally benign alternative to increased energy production.<p>

India</h3></font>
<p>
Bureau of Energy Efficiency is an Indian governmental apex organization created in 2002 responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.<p>

<h3>Japan</h3>
</font><p>
Since the 1973 energy crisis, energy conservation has been a serious issue in Japan. While the Energy Conservation Center promotes energy efficiency in every aspect, private entities are implementing the efficient use of energy to industries.<p>

<h3>New Zeland</h3></font>
In New Zeland the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.

<I>Main Article : Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom</i><p>
Energy Conservation in the United Kingdom has been recieving increased attention over the recent years. Key factors behind this are the Government's commitment to reducing carbon emissions, the projected 'energy gap' in UK electricity generation, and the increasing reliance on imports to meet national energy needs. Domestic housing and road transport are currently two biggest areas.<p>
The UK Government has jointly funded the Energy Saving Trust to promote energy conservation at a consumer, business and community level since 1993.<p>

United States</h3>

<i>Main Article : Energy Conservation in the United States</i>
<P>
The United States is currently the largest single consumer of energy. The U.S. Department of Energy catagorizes national energy use in four broad seectors : transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial.
Energy usage in transportation and residential sectors (about half of U.S. energy consumption) is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers. Commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by business entities and other facility managers. National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors.<p><p>
